# -Min-Max-Number-Comparison
This JavaScript script defines two arrow functions, 'test1' and 'test2', which accept two parameters 'x' and 'y'. 'test1' returns the smaller of the two numbers using Math.min, while 'test2' returns the larger number using Math.max.
The script prompts the user to enter two numbers 'a' and 'b'. Then it invokes both functions with 'a' and 'b' as arguments, logging the results to the console. This script demonstrates how to find the minimum and maximum of two numbers entered by the user.
